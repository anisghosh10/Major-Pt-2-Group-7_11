MENTAL HEALTH PREDICTION IN STUDENT BY Group 7_11

                                                                        ABSTRACT:
                       The language of deficits and problems, rather than resources and strengths, is used in behavioural health treatment, which is based on the medical model. It is now possible to refocus on well-being rather than illness, thanks to advances in the field of positive psychology. Mental health issues, as well as personality disorders, have been shown in studies to have a negative impact on academic performance. Positive mental health, on the other hand, can act as a protective shield against mental illness. The Mental Health data set, which is available in the source repository, is used in this project.
